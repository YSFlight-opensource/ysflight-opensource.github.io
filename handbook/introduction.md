## INTRODUCTION

**YS FLIGHT SIMULATOR** (aka YSFlight, YSFS, YSF or YS) — is a lightweight computer flight simulator and game developed and frequently updated by ***Soji Yamakawa*** aka '*CaptainYS*' from Japan. Interface of game generaly in English & Japanese, but could be translated to other language too.

Development started in 1997 and for now latest YSFlight ver.20181124 already distributed with more than 100 stock add-ons, including aircrafts, sceneries, ground objects, missions and other miscellaneous things.

For single player mode, there are multiple ways of flying on YSFlight. You can:

- Create a new flight, where you may select the plane and scenery of your choice and fly however you choose;
- Create a new formation flight, where you can have a either a diamond or delta formation of the plane you choose, with you as the leader;
- Create an aerial combat, where you fight up to 5 computer AI with up to 2 wingmen, all of whose planes you pick;
- Fly Endurence mode, where you have to survive 900 seconds of rounds of a maximum of 5 AI, with up to 2 wingmen if you want;
- Fly an Intercept mission, where you must protect your base for 900 seconds against up to 5 AI bombers, with up to 2 wingmen;
- Fly a Close Air Support mission, where you must help defend your base for 900 seconds against waves of ground AI;

For most of these modes, you may set the flight enviroment, for example: night or day, wind speed and direction, visibility and fog, with/without ground fire, etc.

After each flight, YSFlight will have a record of it ready, so that you may go back and evaluate your performance. Unless you choose to save this flight, the record will be deleted once you make another flight, or when you close YS. 

Feature called Landing Practice was introduced for offline play. It allows you to attempt an approach and landing in a plane of your choice in any of 15 levels of varying difficulty. 

Acrobatic (aerobatic) flight? YES! In YS you not limited only fly straight, but also can try make any figures. Try make all you know or read Aresti Catalogue for more info.

Made good flight? So,  you can watch replay after flight using “Play Record” button from main screen, then save it to local file and distribute  this record for other YSFlight users.

Want edit record and upload video on YouTube? Then use menu “Flight Record Utility” and your favorite screen recording utylity for PC (i.e SimpleScreenRecorder or Fraps).

Did you already know about demo records?  Go to “Option → AutoDemo → Acrobatic” and have fun to see best acrobatic mouvies!

Do not forget use smoke! It will add cool performance in the sky!

Network play is what most players use, and there are some settings for this as well. First of all, unless you have a firewall or some restriction on your internet settings, all persons with YSFlight installed should be able to host their own server. If you do, a number of different settings is open to you. As in single player mode, you will be able to choose night or day mode, visibility and fog, ground fire, etc.

In network play mode you may: 

- Choose your username, scenery, start position, and IFF option (Identify Friend or Foe); 
- Determine if missiles, guns, bombs, and rockets may be used; 
- Enable or disable the radar gun sight; 
- Enable or disable notification of players taking off or leaving the game; 
- Determine the distance at which other users can identify each other;
- Enable or disable the Third Airplane View (viewing other players and their locations); 
- Determine the radar altitude limit; 
- Enable or disable Mid-air collision and Black out; 

All your settings will apply to anyone who visits and flies on your server. If you are joining someone else's server, you will have to acquire their IP (Internet Protocol) Address. This is usually available either from the person who's hosting the server, or through an online server list hosted on some fansites. 

A common occurence during online play is "lag", where the host's, or your own internet connection becomes overwhelmed and the data transfer is disrupted, resulting in other players seeming to zoom across the sky. This is not a glitch in YSFlight, it is actually a common occurance among many online multi-player games; because the game is hosted by individuals and not servers, each person's Internet bandwith determines how many people may fly on their server without lag. Therefore, if you plan to regularly host a server for 5 or more people, make sure you have at least a DSL connection.

Enjoy, virtual pilots!
